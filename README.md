# Spryker Feature: Navigation

Create complex navigation structure with cms pages, categories, and any other relevant links. You can even group certain items together into secondary menus and customise their look and feel. With the Navigation you can build and manage as many navigation elements as needed. All navigation elements can have their own nested structure of navigation nodes. You can use navigation elements to build your shop's main navigation, footer links for backlinks, etc.
